# Energy Consumption Prediction

A machine learning project to predict building energy usage based on environmental and operational data. Users can provide inputs manually or upload CSV files to get energy consumption predictions, helping optimize efficiency and reduce costs.

## Features

- Predict energy consumption via manual input or CSV upload.
- Handles features like temperature, humidity, occupancy, HVAC & lighting usage, and renewable energy.
- Extracts time-based features (hour, day, month) from timestamps.
- Encodes categorical data for ML model predictions.
- Displays predictions in a user-friendly HTML table or JSON format.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend & ML:** Python, Flask, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **File Handling:** CSV upload
- **Web Interface:** HTML templates with Flask
- **Deployment:** Heroku or any Python-supporting server
